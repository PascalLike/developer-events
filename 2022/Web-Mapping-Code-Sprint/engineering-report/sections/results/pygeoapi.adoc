==== OGC API - Maps implementation

The pygeoapi project implemented support for the OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core draft specification.  Support for the Requirements Class "Map Core" was https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/pull/1048[implemented], reviewed and approved by the pygeoapi development team. As a result, pygeoapi implementations are now able to easily publish geospatial data as dynamic maps thanks to the building block approach of OGC API Standards.

pygeoapi's plugin architecture facilitated the implementation of two plugin backends for maps:

- MapScript: using the MapServer[https://mapserver.org] web mapping engine as the map renderer, using data and styling definitions (Styled Layer Descriptor [SLD], MapServer CLASS configuraiton files).
- WMSFacade: a bridge/mediator to expose existing OGC WMS 1.3 services via OGC API - Maps

The https://docs.pygeoapi.io/en/latest/data-publishing/ogcapi-maps.html[official pygeoapi documentation] provides more information on how to enable the new functionality. A screenshot of the associated OpenAPI/Swagger interface from the implementation is shown in the figure below.

==== OGC API - Coverages browser rendering

pygeoapi gained HTML representation of a coverages, as a lightweight HTML viewer.

This viewer is a Leaflet[https://leafletjs.com/] implementation, which uses the Leaflet.ImageOverlay.Arrugator[https://gitlab.com/IvanSanchez/Leaflet.ImageOverlay.Arrugator/] plugin, and the proj4js[https://github.com/proj4js/proj4js/] library to provide client-side reprojection.

The emphasis is not in the viewer, but rather in the fact that the viewer is the HTML representation of the coverage resource. Whenever a API client requests the coverage resource, it will be given a HTML map viewer, or the JSON-LD representation of the coverage, or the raw coverage data (as PNG, GeoTIFF, NetCDF, etc), in accordance to the established HTTP content negotiation rules ("Accept" HTTP headers, or "f" URL parameter).

This is aligned with pygeoapi's implementation of OGC API - Features, where requesting features as HTML returns a map viewer loaded with those features.
