==== OGC API - Maps implementation

The pygeoapi project implemented support for the OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core draft specification.  Support for the Requirements Class "Map Core" was https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/pull/1048[implemented], reviewed and approved by the pygeoapi development team. As a result, pygeoapi implementations are now able to easily publish geospatial data as dynamic maps thanks to the building block approach of OGC API Standards.

pygeoapi's plugin architecture facilitated the implementation of two plugin backends for maps:

- MapScript: using the MapServer[https://mapserver.org] web mapping engine as the map renderer, using data and styling definitions (Styled Layer Descriptor [SLD], MapServer CLASS configuraiton files).
- WMSFacade: a bridge/mediator to expose existing OGC WMS 1.3 services via OGC API - Maps

The https://docs.pygeoapi.io/en/latest/data-publishing/ogcapi-maps.html[official pygeoapi documentation] provides more information on how to enable the new functionality. A screenshot of the associated OpenAPI/Swagger interface from the implementation is shown in the figure below.

==== OGC API Tiles updates

TODO: Joana

Tile Metadata: 

Support for the Tile Set Metadata schema has been added to TileJSON MapBox. It is also possible to support any format by adding a JSON metadata file directly into the filesystem. As well, the absence of metadata does not represent an issue, facilitating support for different tiles providers.
