==== OGC API - Tiles implementation

Leaflet has built-in support for map tiles (or "TileLayer"s), but its internal implementation has significant constrains: All TileLayers must share the same coordinate system, must be aligned to the same origin of coordinates, and all tiles in any given TileLayer must have the same pixel size.

The flexibility of OGC API - Tiles in regards of tile size and origin of coordinates both prove a handicap for a Leaflet client implementation.

The reached consensus is to ignore TileMatrixSets which do not have a constant tile size, or that do not have a common origin of coordinates for the (0,0) tiles.
